## Overview

### Purpose 

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your approach to reading and enhancing SQL queries. Reviewers are not looking for one specific solution but rather a conversation starter for how you approach problems.

### Prompt

Please rewrite this query to make it more streamlined and readable and to fix any mistakes that may be present. Be prepared to talk through your reasoning.

### Submission

When complete, please commit your SQL file (something like `my_query.sql`) to a publicly-available Github repository and share the link to the repository with your recruiter. Please ensure this repository is publicly available for the duration of the hiring process.
